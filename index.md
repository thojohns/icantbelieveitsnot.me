# Current Projects

Currently working on Android stuff, specifically the *Visible R2* from ZTE.

[This repository](https://github.com/thojohns/android_kernel_zte_z5151v) hosts the stock kernel, tweaked to compile correctly and play nice with Magisk.

If you want to flash TWRP onto your R2, [check out this guide on XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=79956857&postcount=54) (WIP).
